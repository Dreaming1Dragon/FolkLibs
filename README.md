# The FolkLibs
vulkan raylib -> vulkan lib -> vulklib -> folklib

I want to make a collection of libraries that can be used together to replace a game engine while being much more versitile than an engine.

## How do I license this
I guess I just won't accept pull requests untill I can figure out how to license this thing.
I feel like a permissive license is irresponsible but that is what everyone is doing, I found LGPL but that seems to enforce ideals on the project using the library.
I don't care about what other people do I just want to protect my code.
